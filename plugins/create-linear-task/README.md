# Create Linear Task plugin

This directory is the ChatGPT distribution layer for the canonical
[`skills/create-linear-task`](../../skills/create-linear-task/SKILL.md) agent skill. The
standalone skill remains the source of all workflow instructions, configuration, scripts, and
agent metadata. Do not edit the generated copy under `skills/create-linear-task`.

The package uses the current portable Agent Plugins layout: `plugin.json` is the root manifest and
hosts discover bundled skills under `skills/`. `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` is a generated
compatibility fallback. The plugin intentionally has no MCP manifest or server; the skill uses a
Linear integration already available to the host, and it returns a draft when Linear is not
available.

The package shape follows the official OpenAI documentation for
[packaging plugins](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/plugins),
[skills-only plugins](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/concepts/skills), and
[connecting and testing a plugin](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/deploy/connect-chatgpt).

## Synchronize, validate, and package

From the repository root, regenerate the bundled snapshot whenever the canonical skill changes:

```sh
python3.12 plugins/create-linear-task/scripts/sync_plugin.py
python3.12 plugins/create-linear-task/scripts/sync_plugin.py --check
python3.12 -m unittest tests.test_create_linear_task_plugin -v
```

The check compares every selected bundled skill file byte-for-byte with the canonical directory and
also checks the generated compatibility manifest. Synchronization and ZIP packaging share that
selection logic, so transient files such as `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, and `*.pyo` are ignored by
both. The repository test suite runs the same drift check and verifies that these files cannot
change the archive.

Create a deterministic submission archive and optionally verify it later:

```sh
python3.12 plugins/create-linear-task/scripts/package_plugin.py \
  --output /tmp/create-linear-task-plugin.zip
python3.12 plugins/create-linear-task/scripts/package_plugin.py \
  --output /tmp/create-linear-task-plugin.zip --check
```

## Distribution paths

- For workspace/private distribution, put this package in a GitHub repository with a supported
  marketplace manifest. A workspace admin imports it through **Admin → Plugins → Add → Import
  marketplace**, supplies the GitHub repository and marketplace path, reviews the import, and sets
  role installation policy. Follow the official
  [workspace plugin management guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/plugin-management).
- For public distribution, create a **Skills only** draft in the OpenAI plugin submission portal,
  upload the generated ZIP, complete the public review requirements, and publish only after
  approval. Follow the official
  [public submission guide](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/deploy/submission).
- For a local desktop preflight only, expose `plugins/create-linear-task` from a local marketplace,
  restart the ChatGPT desktop app, and install **Create Linear Task** from the Plugins Directory.
  A local preflight does not establish web/mobile availability.

This repository packages the skill but does not claim that a workspace marketplace has imported it
or that a public listing has been reviewed and published.

## Manual ChatGPT acceptance

Run the synchronization, validation, and packaging commands above, distribute the plugin through
one of the appropriate paths above, install it from the Plugins tab, and confirm that installation
does not request an MCP connection.

### Activation acceptance

Use this to prove only that the installed plugin and bundled skill are discovered and invoked:

1. Start a fresh ChatGPT web or mobile chat with **Create Linear Task** enabled.
2. Explicitly select the plugin/skill with `@`, then prompt:

   > I want to prepare a development issue. Do not draft or create it yet. Tell me which configured
   > repository and Linear target context this workflow needs before it can proceed.

3. Confirm that ChatGPT identifies the `create-linear-task` workflow, asks for missing
   repository/target context rather than inventing it, and performs no Linear mutation. Repeat in a
   fresh mobile chat when mobile availability is part of the acceptance target.

Passing this procedure verifies activation only. ChatGPT web/mobile does not implicitly inherit a
checkout or filesystem from the machine or VPS where this repository was packaged.

### Functional acceptance

Run this separately only when the ChatGPT session can genuinely access all of the following:

- a repository checkout whose directory identity matches a project in the bundled `config.toml`;
- the relevant repository instructions and implementation files;
- a Linear integration authorized for the configured team/project and its complete label catalog.

In a fresh chat, explicitly invoke **Create Linear Task** and ask it to create or refine a designated
test issue using that accessible repository. Verify the rendered human sections, collapsed agent
instructions, classification, exact configured target, and intended labels. After the mutation,
verify that the workflow rereads the issue and confirms its exact title, team, project, description,
and label IDs.

If the repository or Linear context is unavailable, stop after activation acceptance. A draft or
context request in that environment does not constitute functional acceptance of rendering,
classification, mutation, or final reread.
