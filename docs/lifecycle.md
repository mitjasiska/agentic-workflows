## Task start

A repository is resolved as `projects_root / repo_name`. Each must be its permanent Git
checkout, already on the configured base branch, with a clean working tree (including
untracked files) and no unfinished Git operation. The base must track a same-named
branch on a remote. `task start` fetches that upstream into `FETCH_HEAD` and updates
using `merge --ff-only`; it refuses local-only commits or divergence. It does not
switch, stash, reset, or force-update branches.

The command loads the current issue through
[Linear's GraphQL API](https://linear.app/developers/graphql), resolves the project,
updates the base, and asks Herdr to create or focus a worktree. Herdr chooses its location. New default
branches start with the lowercase issue identifier and a title slug (up to 100
characters). The identifier is the stable identity: renaming a Linear title never
renames an existing branch or creates a replacement workspace.

After Git and Herdr confirm the exact checkout and focus, the command sets the
issue to its team's exact `In Progress` status (unless it is already there). It
then starts the selected adapter in the returned pane and sends the same workflow-
owned handoff: current identifier, title, exact description, resolved checkout,
branch, optional slice, and standard implementation instructions. Both agents
are told to read repository instructions, inspect before editing, implement the
requested scope, prefer test-first / red-green-refactor for testable behavior and
fixes where practical, and use focused tests (including new or changed tests) plus
inexpensive syntax/lint/diff checks during implementation. TDD is optional for docs,
UI/visual work, research, and other unsuitable tasks. Expensive full suites are not
the default during iteration; explicit issue/repository requirements still govern
final validation. Agents stop for independent review without
committing, pushing, merging, or opening a PR. The Python workflow owns the Linear
lookup; the execution agent is told not to contact Linear or read its credentials.
No task description file is written into the worktree.

The complete Linear issue is the task source of truth, with user-defined structure.
Requested scope, acceptance criteria, constraints, and task-specific implementation
guidance apply wherever they appear. The separate workflow-owned implementation
instructions remain authoritative for lifecycle and safety behavior regardless of
issue formatting.

Agent-backed starts and from-scratch loops share the
[issue structure policy](configuration.md#linear-issue-structure). The default
`warn` mode prints a non-blocking warning if the configured collapsed marker
(default `Agent instructions`) is absent; `ignore` skips the check. Only explicit
`required` mode rejects absence, before any Git update, worktree creation/reuse,
Linear status change, or context allocation/agent launch. This checks only the
configured marker's presence; it does not parse, extract, or privilege its contents,
require other headings, or validate publication labels. The complete description
is passed unchanged in all three modes.

`task start ISSUE --no-agent` performs the same workspace preparation and Linear
transition without starting an agent. It does not require an `Agent instructions`
block, `[agent]`, or an installed agent and cannot be combined with `--agent`,
`--model`, or `--mode`.

### Implementation readiness outcomes

With [task assessment enabled](configuration.md#implementation-task-readiness),
the shared implementation handoff asks the current agent to assess readiness
before implementation mutations using the full issue and bounded read-only
repository inspection. The assessment is semantic agent guidance, not a new
issue parser, separate agent, planning phase, or controller boundary.

The agent emits a small structured outcome in its conversation before edits:

```json
{"task_assessment":{"state":"ready","summary":"Outcome and verification are clear","questions":[]}}
```

`ready` proceeds automatically in the same turn. `blocked` has a concise summary
and a nonempty `questions` list of specific blockers, and ends the turn before
implementation mutations. Interactive `task start` remains a launch command:
its exit status confirms handoff delivery, not assessment or implementation
completion. Read the structured outcome in the implementation pane and supply
clarification there; the agent reassesses and continues outstanding work in that
conversation. It must not rewrite the issue or record a separate plan.

Automated implementation passes include `task_assessment` in their existing
temporary result JSON, alongside `pass_id`, `state`, `summary`, `checks`, and
`resolutions`. This includes from-scratch launches and later completion/fix
handoffs; each assesses the current outstanding work without replaying completed
work. `ready` requires an empty question list. An assessment block requires
overall `state=blocked`; it cannot be accepted as completed. If implementation
later blocks after a ready assessment, the overall state is still `blocked`.
Only an execution failure before assessment may omit the field with `state=failed`.
With assessment disabled, the original result fields are used.

The loop validates this contract and retains the small outcome with the existing
pass record, displaying its questions in text and JSON status reports. A blocked
assessment escalates the run with no review or automatic retry. The controller
compares the existing before/after checkout snapshots and flags changes across a
blocked assessment for inspection; this detects Git-visible changes, not transient
edits or all possible side effects. The agent's pre-mutation instruction remains
the assessment gate. Normal workspace preparation and Linear status transition
have already occurred before the agent receives the task.

After the user resolves the questions (in the existing conversation or by updating
Linear), inspect the idle context and use `task loop ISSUE --new`. The workflow
fetches the current issue and resumes the same verified implementation conversation;
it does not relaunch the initial agent. A ready reassessment proceeds to ordinary
implementation and independent review. `--continue` cannot resume an escalated
block: it remains exclusive to a saved graceful pause. Session/checkout checks,
interruption refusal, pass limits, and stop behavior are unchanged. See
[checkpoint recovery](#checkpoint-and-interruption-recovery).

## Workspace lifecycle and slices

An existing workspace is reused only when Git and Herdr agree on one usable branch
and checkout. Dirty task worktrees are preserved; the permanent base checkout
must remain clean. Branch-only, locked, prunable, inconsistent, or ambiguous state
stops with an error. `task start` never deletes a branch, worktree, workspace, or
session. Scope is recorded in `agentic-workflows-scope.json` in the worktree's
private Git directory (`git rev-parse --absolute-git-dir`), outside tracked files.
The record contains only its version, issue identifier, branch and slice name
(or explicit `null` for a default workspace), never the Linear description.

The default remains one issue, one branch, one PR. For multiple implementation
slices, select a stable name explicitly:

```sh
task start DEV-13 --slice codex-handoff
task start DEV-13 --slice workspace-lifecycle
```

These create/reuse `dev-13-codex-handoff` and `dev-13-workspace-lifecycle`.
Slice names normalize accents, case, spaces and underscores to an ASCII branch
suffix; empty names, path/ref syntax, control characters and suffixes over 100
characters are rejected. The prompt names the slice and instructs the selected
agent to ask if its scope is unclear. Other slices remain untouched.

Without `--slice`, exactly one candidate can be reused, including one originally
created as a slice. The resolved workspace's recorded scope is used in the agent
prompt, so an `importer` slice retains its restriction when reopened without
`--slice`, even after a Linear title or Herdr label changes.

Legacy workspaces without scope metadata are refused until an explicit `--slice`
matching their branch suffix establishes their scope. A branch name matching the
current title is not proof of default scope. Invalid/mismatched records and
explicit selectors conflicting with recorded scope are refused; existing scope
is never overwritten. If a metadata write fails, the workspace remains intact
and neither the Linear transition nor agent startup proceeds.

Multiple candidate branches/worktrees (including live remote
branches) are listed and refused. Use `--slice` with the desired branch's suffix
after the issue ID to disambiguate a slice. For a legacy title-derived branch,
this explicitly adopts that suffix as its scope. Historical candidates are not
silently filtered out to guess an active one.

### Remote branches and PR history

Remote branch discovery uses `git ls-remote --heads` on every configured remote.
Cached `refs/remotes/*` are never evidence of a live branch, so stale tracking refs
do not require manual pruning. A live remote-only branch stops creation for that
selection. Remote lookup failure stops safely; no fetch refspecs are added or
force-applied.

For a `github.com` base upstream, the workflow checks the
[GitHub pull request API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)
for all PR states and pages for the selected branch in that repository. Any merged
or closed PR makes the branch historical, even after a squash merge and remote
branch deletion. This check also runs before creating a new branch, to avoid
recycling a historical name. A successful empty result or only open PRs permits
the selection. Git ancestry and `git branch --merged` are never used as a proxy.

Public repositories need no GitHub credentials within unauthenticated API limits.
Private repositories/rate limits require an existing `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`
with pull-request read access; `gh` is not required. API/network errors or malformed
responses refuse the selection. PR history is checked in the configured base's
upstream repository; if configured remotes point to different repositories, reuse
is refused because cross-repository PR history is not supported. Hosts other
than `github.com` permit fresh workspaces but refuse existing-workspace reuse
because merge history cannot be established. Inspect PR state and retire old local
work manually, or choose a new slice; the command never cleans it up for you.

## Failure and retry behavior

Agent selection, option validation, and executable availability are checked before
Git, Herdr, or Linear mutation. If Git/Herdr preparation fails, Linear is not
updated and no agent is started. If the Linear update fails, the valid workspace
remains available and no agent is started. Check Linear and rerun.

Launch confirmation does not prove eventual implementation success; later model,
provider, or implementation failures remain visible in the selected agent. The
workspace and Linear's `In Progress` status remain intact on handoff failure.

The returned pane must be an available shell. An existing instance of the selected
agent anywhere in the workspace prevents a duplicate launch. Continue that session,
exit it before requesting a fresh handoff, or use `--no-agent` to focus it. After a
timeout, inspect the pane before retrying: the process or prompt may already have
started. There is no automatic resubmission, fallback agent/session, or killing of
a potentially working agent. Do not run simultaneous starts for the same repository
or edit its base checkout during a start.

See [handoff transport](architecture.md#handoff-transport) for agent-specific
readiness checks, delivery guarantees, and timeouts.

### Codex first-use trust and setup

For `task start`, initial `task loop` implementation, fresh `task review`, and
`task integrate`, a recognized Codex **Trust this folder?** menu or sign-in method menu pauses the
original workflow command before task delivery. The message identifies the context,
checkout, workspace, pane, terminal and any already observed provider session.
`task contexts ISSUE` shows `awaiting_user`.
This works with any checkout path, including newly created isolated checkouts.

1. Keep the original workflow command running. Inspect the identified Codex pane
   and make the trust or authentication decision there yourself.
2. Return to the terminal running the workflow command and press Enter. This
   acknowledges your action to the workflow; it sends no keystrokes to Codex.
3. The workflow reconciles that same process and terminal, finds the provider
   session using its original readiness marker, and verifies recorded history
   before attempting the first task delivery. It allows up to 30 seconds for
   transient post-trust readiness and provider/history verification. If the
   recognized menu remains, it asks again. Timeout, replacement, additional session
   input or conflicting evidence stops delivery. A session reported by startup is
   retained even when startup was non-ready and may continue through the human
   wait, provided every later runtime observation and provider discovery matches
   it. Missing or conflicting identity prevents delivery. Initial loop and
   integration startup also retain that identity while history is unreadable
   during setup; they must verify the recorded readiness turn after setup before
   sending the task.

Do not rerun `start`, `review`, `loop`, or `integrate` to get past trust. The original
command retains the handoff and result paths, and the execution timeout
starts after launch/delivery completes. It neither launches a replacement nor
replays a queued prompt. `loop --continue` is for saved loop pause boundaries;
it does not acknowledge a startup trust dialog.

An interactive workflow stdin is required for this continuation. Closed stdin,
interruption, unsupported/clipped menus, unavailable process evidence, or identity
changes fail closed. If the original command ends, inspect the retained pane and
context; a new command cannot reconstruct that in-memory launch or deliver its
handoff. An `awaiting_user` context continues to prevent replacement allocation
even after its owner exits; normal confirmed cleanup can retire the mapping.
Trust/setup after a queue attempt is outside this recovery path: delivery may
already have happened, so inspect the exact session and never blindly resend.

## Task review

Review the existing task checkout in a new independent reviewer pane:

```sh
task review DEV-20
task review DEV-20 --agent pi --model <provider/model> --mode high
task review DEV-20 --resume DEV-20-R2
task review DEV-20 --resume DEV-20-R2 --json
```

Configure `[reviewer]` separately from implementation; see
[agent and reviewer selection](configuration.md#agent-and-reviewer-selection).

The fresh form always allocates the next review context (`DEV-20-R1`,
`DEV-20-R2`, etc.). It splits a pane in the existing task tab, preserving focus,
and labels it with that exact context ID. It never prepares another worktree or
inherits implementation or previous reviewer conversation. Codex and Pi use the
shared execution adapters and repository permission profiles. Those permission
capabilities do not authorize task writes during review.

### Validation guidance

Fresh reviews and same-reviewer re-reviews share the
[review validation strategy](configuration.md#review-validation), defaulting to
`focused_first`. Reviewers inspect the full diff and requirements, assess test
quality (meaningful assertions and missing edge cases), and collect a complete
batch of substantive actionable findings. They continue inspecting after a defect
and run targeted tests needed to investigate potential problems.

On a findings pass, `focused_first` skips expensive full-suite validation before
reporting the batch; checks explicitly required on every pass still apply.
The implementer fixes the batch and reruns relevant tests, then the same reviewer
rechecks fixes and regressions (`task review --resume` or the loop's automatic
re-review). `exhaustive` requests full validation even on findings passes, with
the same inspection and batching obligations.

When otherwise clean, reviewers run all final validation required by the Linear
issue and repository policy, including a full suite when required. Explicit
requirements such as "all tests must pass" are never weakened. Enforced, evidenced
CI may serve as a separately identified final merge gate where those requirements
permit it; reviewers cannot assume CI exists or silently substitute it for checks.

Tests must not mutate tracked or untracked Git-visible task state. If a check
cannot run safely, reviewers record `not_run` and explain why; restoring test
mutations afterward does not make the test safe. Existing `checks` entries report
commands, observed results, failures, skipped checks and reasons, and evidence for
any separate CI gate. An unrun check cannot be reported as passed, and missing
required final validation without a permitted, evidenced gate cannot be claimed
as a clean review.

This is prompt guidance, not controller-enforced proof of command execution. The
existing result/publication acceptance and Git snapshot safety contracts remain
unchanged.

### Workspace resolution and pinned state

Each pass fetches the latest Linear issue and resolves the configured repository,
local base branch, exact existing task branch/worktree, scope metadata, and
context registry mappings. No title-derived branch guesses, Git fetch, base
advancement, worktree repair, Linear mutation, PR operation, or automatic routing
of findings occurs.
Review requires exactly one active implementation context mapping with a verified
pane in the open task workspace. There is no review slice selector.
The permanent checkout must pass the existing base safety checks; the task checkout
may have staged, unstaged, and untracked work. Ambiguous slices/worktrees and
missing or inconsistent mappings stop before reviewer launch.

Review pins the current local base commit. A versioned SHA-256 fingerprint covers
that commit, task HEAD/branch, semantic index entries/flags, Git status, file names,
bytes, executable bits, symlink targets, and non-ignored untracked files. Initialized
submodule state is included recursively. Conflicted/unfinished Git operations and
unsupported file types (such as non-regular untracked files) fail closed. Index
stat-cache refreshes and mtimes do not affect the fingerprint. Ignored validation
artifacts are excluded. Two matching reads establish each snapshot. Checkpoints run
immediately after launch/resume returns, at result/status polls, and immediately
before accepting the final result. Any checkpoint that observes drift permanently
invalidates that pass, even if the original bytes are later restored. Final acceptance
also requires the ending fingerprint to match the pinned starting fingerprint.
A mutation perfectly restored between checkpoints is an accepted v1 limitation;
no worktree lock or filesystem watcher is installed.

### Exact resume and provider history

`--resume` selects only the exact registered review context. It checks role, issue,
repository, checkout, server, terminal, and persisted provider history. It retains
the actual conversation and the recorded agent/model/mode. Fresh review requires
explicit model and mode (config or flags) so provider defaults cannot drift between
passes. Resume rejects selection flags; use a fresh reviewer for different settings.
Unknown, retired, uncertain, busy, mismatched, or non-resumable IDs never fall back
to fresh review. A verified missing pane can be recreated in the task's currently verified tab
with the same context ID/session. A terminal uniquely relocated to another pane
within the task workspace retains its context and session; only the verified pane/tab
location is updated. Conflicting or ambiguous runtime/session evidence fails. Tab
rearrangement within the task workspace and manual pane renaming do not select a
different reviewer. Codex uses its exact thread queue and persisted prompt receipt;
Pi requires an exact persisted session-file reference from Herdr.
Pi review launches and restarts explicitly load the bundled session-reporting
extension, so discovery does not depend on a globally installed Herdr integration.
It reports Pi's native session path; a startup path may precede persisted history.
Pi resume rechecks the saved model/thinking mode through the same capability check
as fresh launch; unsupported or clamped settings fail before the follow-up prompt.
Pi verification retains the immutable conversation ID from the persisted header in
the existing context registry session reference. Resume checks that ID and actual history
again after startup, before delivering instructions; recreating an empty session at
the same path is rejected. Session references first reported during review polling
are recorded through the same registry observer as launch. Later conflicting
identities fail; a reported path alone never establishes resumability. Explicit
empty, blank, or malformed `--resume` selectors fail before allocation.

### Completion and review permissions

Herdr may infer `idle` while Pi is still working. Idle/done without a structured
result, startup gaps, and temporarily absent/unknown observations remain pending;
elapsed startup time or an earlier working observation does not establish completion.
Acceptance requires validated output and idle/done, plus final identity/state checks.
Without conclusive output or a verified failure, the existing workflow timeout bounds
the wait, including when a stopped process is only reported as absent/unknown.

The handoff separates authoritative read-only review instructions, resolved and
pinned metadata, and latest Linear requirements. Embedded implementation-agent
instructions remain task context. Reviewers may inspect and validate, but cannot
edit task files, fix, stage, commit, push, merge, modify Linear, or change PRs.
Their only output-file write is a private temporary JSON result outside the task
checkout. The workflow waits for the same terminal/session to settle, validates a
pass-specific nonce and strict result shape, then removes the temporary directory.
No general durable semantic report is stored; only the clean acceptance and
bounded public publishing metadata described under [task pr](#task-pr) are retained.
A blocked pass, timeout, or interruption leaves
the pane intact. Context health and resumability are determined separately from the
pass verdict using live pane/terminal/session identity and provider history. A verified
reviewer remains resumable after a pause or tab move; release the pause before submitting
its next follow-up. If the agent exits back to its shell, explicit resume restarts it in
the same mapped pane and verifies the retained conversation before sending the handoff.
Closing a pane preserves verified session evidence for later exact resume and pane recreation.
Temporary verification failures retain last-known verified resumability; every resume
still rechecks provider history. Missing, ambiguous, or replaced identity remains uncertain and cannot
be resumed implicitly. `--timeout` defaults to 1800 seconds after prompt delivery.

### Structured output and exit status

`--json` emits a version-1 `ReviewResult`, independent of human CLI formatting:

- `state`: `clean`, `findings`, `blocked`, or `failed`; `invalidated` distinguishes
  implementation-state invalidation from other blocking conditions.
- `findings`: severity (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`), explanation, concrete
  file/location or other evidence, and optional requirement/test linkage text.
- `checks`: name, result (`passed`, `failed`, `not_run`), and details.
- `context_id`, `pass_id`, `pass_kind` (`fresh`/`resumed`), `execution`
  (`kind`/`model`/`mode`), pinned `review_state`, and `post_fingerprint`.
- `summary`: a human-readable explanation, never an automation verdict source.

Exit status is 0 for clean, 2 for findings, 3 for blocked/invalidated, and 1 for
failure. Missing/malformed output cannot be clean; drift overrides any model verdict.
Preflight errors stop before a pass exists and are reported on stderr. Findings,
validation limitations, and stopped/blocked agents require human action when using
this single-pass command. Automatic findings routing is an explicit `task loop` action.

## Task loop

```sh
task loop DEV-20
task loop DEV-20 --from-review
task loop DEV-20 --r-agent codex --r-model gpt-6-astra --r-mode high --max-reviews 3 --max-passes 6
task loop DEV-20 --i-agent codex --i-model gpt-6-astra --i-mode high
task loop DEV-20 --pause-after-current
task loop DEV-20 --status --json
task loop DEV-20 --continue
```

With no implementation context or context history, `task loop ISSUE` prepares
and runs the initial implementation itself. It shares `task start`'s configurable
issue structure preflight, project/base resolution, base update, default workspace
create/reuse, and Linear `In Progress` transition. Both implementation and reviewer selections
are validated before preparation mutates Git, Herdr, or Linear. Preparation
failure prevents the Linear update; a failed Linear update leaves the prepared
workspace but allocates no context and launches no agent.

This entry supports only the unsliced default workspace, including a workspace
prepared earlier with `task start --no-agent`. Existing slice scope, ambiguous or
historical workspaces, and retired/conflicting context history are refused.
It does not adopt an unregistered running agent or repair a missing context.
The first implementation handoff already contains the loop's nonce-bound structured
result contract. Validated completion proceeds directly to fresh review, without
an extra implementation turn just to collect completion. Blocked, failed, malformed,
timed-out, or uncertain delivery stops before review. Idleness is never completion.

Normal configured use is `task loop ISSUE`, with initial implementation settings
from `[agent]` and fresh reviewer settings from `[reviewer]`. Optional `--i-agent`,
`--i-model`, and `--i-mode` override implementation; `--r-agent`, `--r-model`, and
`--r-mode` override review. Each option resolves independently over its role's
configuration. Both roles require explicit resolved model and mode before mutation.
The loop rejects generic `--agent`, `--model`, and `--mode`; those flags are unchanged
on `task start` and `task review`. Implementation overrides are refused when a
context already exists (except matching saved selections during pre-handoff
startup recovery), with `--from-review`, and with controls. Existing
implementation contexts always retain their recorded settings.

When an exact implementation context already exists, start with it idle in the
open task checkout. The default path still resumes it to finish outstanding
implementation and validation and collect a structured completion result. For an
already-completed implementation, this pass reports work without replaying it.

When you know the initial implementation is complete, `--from-review` explicitly
starts a new loop at fresh review, without sending an initial implementation
completion turn. It still verifies and saves the exact single idle, resumable
implementation context for later fixes. The human selects the starting boundary;
idle status alone never establishes completion. Existing-context entries never
adopt an arbitrary running turn or create a replacement implementation context.
Let its current turn finish before starting. `--from-review` can accompany `--new`,
but cannot accompany `--continue`, `--status`, or `--pause-after-current`.

The first review uses the existing fresh review primitive with a newly allocated
independent reviewer. It receives current requirements and actual repository
state, without implementation conversation or completion prose. Implementation
findings return to the original implementation context. A focused re-review uses
the exact same reviewer context, previous findings, and structured fix claims.
Review remains read-only and retains the single-pass drift checks. Clean review
terminates; there is no publication, merge, cleanup, or Linear completion. Only
from-scratch preparation changes Linear to `In Progress`.

Implementation and reviewer contexts require recorded explicit model and mode,
provider-verifiable immutable session identity, and consistent registry/runtime
bindings. In particular, a Pi runtime without a persisted session reference is
insufficient. An established context that is missing, uncertain, or non-resumable
stops the loop; it never triggers bootstrap.
Reviewer resume may recreate a stopped/missing pane through the existing review
primitive after verifying the original conversation; it never allocates a
replacement conversation. No replacement implementation or reviewer is selected
automatically. Reviewer flags (`--r-agent`, `--r-model`, `--r-mode`) apply only to the
first fresh reviewer; later passes and explicit continuation preserve recorded
settings.

### Boundaries and graceful pause

The saved next phase is one of `initial_implementation` (fresh launch),
`implementation` (completion in an established conversation), `review` (fresh
review), `fixes`, or `rereview`. Fresh-launch and review-start checkpoints record
their explicit origin; existing version-1 completion checkpoints remain valid.
Each completed pass and its next boundary are checkpointed before any automatic
handoff. From another terminal, request
`--pause-after-current` while either agent is working. The controller lets that
pass finish, validates/collects its result, and stops before the next handoff.
It does not send cancellation or restart the agent. A clean terminal review
still finishes cleanly because no handoff remains; failure/human decisions still
escalate rather than becoming a resumable pause.

Pause is a sticky SQLite flag, checked between passes and atomically with each
handoff claim after preflight. The committed claim is the start of the current
pass: a request ordered before it prevents delivery, while one ordered after it
waits for that pass. Result writes cannot overwrite a concurrent pause request.
The controller holds the existing review/publication worktree lock throughout;
pause and status use separate short transactions and remain available while it
is running. Do not type additional agent prompts or edit the checkout during a run.

`--continue` accepts only a saved `paused` boundary. It explicitly clears that
pause, verifies the exact checkout/base, requirement fingerprint, contexts,
sessions, and idle runtimes, then executes the pending phase. Before an initial
launch, it instead verifies the reserved context and its exact empty shell; no
provider session exists yet. Every continuation awaiting the initial handoff
repeats the full [startup recovery proof](#checkpoint-and-interruption-recovery),
including related-pane session/activity checks and the final shell/base checks
before claiming delivery. Proof obtained before a pause is never reused.
It retains the saved implementation options without
rerunning workspace preparation or the Linear transition. It never repeats a
completed pass. Changes to requirements, checkout, identity, or resumability stop
for inspection. A later pause remains sticky. `--status`, agent idleness, and
repeating the ordinary `loop` command never continue a paused loop. The narrow
pre-handoff startup recovery exception is described below. Pause/status find
the checkpoint through the context registry without loading credentials,
workflow configuration, or Linear; continuation fetches current requirements.
All three controls resolve the task checkout from implementation/review contexts.
Retained integration (`G`) contexts keep their separate isolated checkout and
provenance; their paths do not participate in this lookup. Missing or conflicting
task checkout paths still stop the command.

### Routing, bounds, and results

Loop reviews extend each finding with a stable `F1`-style `id` and a `category`:
`implementation` or `human_decision`. The reviewer must preserve unresolved IDs
and report all remaining findings, including regressions. Product, architecture,
design, scope, planning, and ambiguous decisions belong to `human_decision` and
stop automatic routing, including when mixed with implementation defects.
Manual review still accepts its original finding shape. The controller never
classifies findings from free-form explanations.

Fix results identify every supplied finding and describe the claimed resolution;
the reviewer independently checks those claims. Duplicate/missing/unknown IDs,
malformed output, failed checks claimed as completed work, blocked agents,
delivery/identity failures, or absent output stop for inspection. No transport or
uncertain pass is automatically retried. An unchanged content snapshot after
fixes, repeated finding-ID sets, identical findings with renamed IDs, or retention
of every previous unresolved ID also stops as non-progress.

Defaults are at most three review passes, six total implementation/review passes,
and 1800 seconds of waiting per delivered pass. Startup keeps the adapters' own
bounded receipt checks. `--max-reviews` accepts 1–20, `--max-passes` accepts 1–40,
and `--timeout` accepts 1–86400 seconds. These bounds persist across pauses.
The initial implementation consumes one total pass and its configured wait timeout;
review count remains zero until review runs. Exhausting the review budget stops
before fixes that could not be re-reviewed.
Selection, timeout, and limit flags cannot accompany controls.

The compact final report includes implementation summaries, review iterations,
substantive findings, claimed fixes, validation and limitations, final review
state, context IDs, and whether human action is required. `--json` supplies the
versioned equivalent, including the pending boundary and any uncertain active
pass. Review-start reports include only passes actually run: a clean first review
counts as one pass, with no initial implementation summary or validation claim.
Run/continue exit codes are 0 for clean, 3 for pause/escalation, 130 for
caught interruption, and 1 for preflight/storage errors. Successful pause/status
requests exit 0; their reported state remains authoritative.

### Checkpoint and interruption recovery

`agentic-workflows-loop.sqlite3` in the worktree's private Git directory retains
one current checkpoint: exact bindings/session IDs, requirement fingerprint,
snapshot, counters/limits, next phase, active pass nonce, routing findings, and
bounded result summaries needed after a pause. It contains no issue description,
transcripts, credentials, report archive, or publication approval. A versioned
result and a post-checkpoint pass-result callback provide integration points for
future report persistence.

Before the initial handoff, the controller reserves the implementation context
and saves a version-3 checkpoint with its ID and explicit implementation settings.
This makes pause/status available even before launch. A pause before the handoff
claim leaves that exact shell reservation pending for `--continue`. The durable
claim precedes labeling, agent startup, and task delivery. Observed provider
identity is retained in the registry immediately and added to the checkpoint as
soon as it can be verified. Launch, provider verification, and polling share one
persistence observer, so later Pi path-only reports retain the verified immutable
conversation ID. The same session must serve later fixes. Pi initial
loop launches load the session reporter used by review; ordinary `task start`
launch arguments are unchanged.

Read-only Linear issue retrieval retries HTTP 408, 429, 500, 502, 503 and 504,
connection failures, and timeouts at most twice, waiting 0.5 then 1 second. Each
request retains its 30-second transport timeout. Diagnostics report only the
status/failure class and retry count, never credentials or server response bodies.
Authentication/access errors, malformed JSON/issue data, and GraphQL errors stop
without retries. Exhausted retries stop the command. Linear mutations are never
automatically replayed: after an uncertain status update, a later command retrieves
the issue again before deciding whether an update is still needed. A confirmed
`In Progress` state needs no write.

An availability failure after reservation but before the first handoff reports
that you can repeat the ordinary `task loop ISSUE` command. That command can
recover an **escalated version-3 initial checkpoint** only when it has zero passes
and reviews, no active claim, no provider identity, no reviewer or completed
records, and no findings/history. This includes checkpoints from before this
recovery support; diagnostic wording does not authorize a retry. Fresh validation
must establish the exact issue/repository/worktree/branch/base/Herdr binding,
original unsliced task scope, unchanged requirements and pinned Git-visible
snapshot, and the original
`launching` context with its original model/mode and terminal. The pane must have
no session evidence and a positively observed idle foreground shell. PID equality
alone is insufficient: Herdr's foreground argv must name an ordinary interactive
system shell and match that process's local executable and command line. This
requires readable `/proc` evidence on Herdr's host/PID namespace. Other panes in
the task workspace, or reporting a cwd/foreground cwd in the task checkout, must
also have explicit sessionless, inactive agent reports and verified shell processes.
A missing report, a retained provider session, or contradictory activity blocks
recovery even when the pane reports no agent. Missing,
replaced, moved, ambiguous, busy, or conflicting contexts/panes refuse recovery.
Authentication failures, invalid requirements, and continued unavailability do
not bypass these checks or reset the saved checkpoint.

Recovery holds the same controller lock as review/publication. A short transaction
compares the entire validated checkpoint before making the initial boundary ready;
a concurrent retry cannot deliver another handoff. The configured base ref is
resolved again after shell preflight and compared with the pinned base before
claiming the handoff; checking only that the old commit exists is insufficient.
A pending pause is retained, including a request during the first recovery
preflight while this narrowly recoverable checkpoint still reports `escalated`,
and the normal state machine must still claim the pass atomically before startup
or delivery. Such a pause sets only the sticky flag: successful revalidation
returns `paused` without launching, and `--continue` still requires that paused
boundary. Other terminal/escalated checkpoints do not acquire this exception.
The same run ID and I context are used; workspace preparation and
the Linear status transition are not repeated. Recorded implementation/reviewer
selections, timeout and bounds survive changed local defaults. Explicit matching
options are accepted; conflicting overrides and `--from-review` are refused.

Any handoff claim or observed provider identity makes delivery uncertain and
requires inspection, even with no completed pass. Other escalated, running,
interrupted, paused, completed, and established-review checkpoints cannot use this
path. Requirements, Git/base, binding or runtime drift reports the recovery blocker
without repairing state or allocating a replacement context. `--continue` remains
exclusive to pauses, and `--new` cannot replace an unfinished initial reservation.
The failed DEV-75 workspace is a live acceptance candidate only if all these
checks still pass; development tests use disposable state and do not alter it.

A crash between context reservation and checkpoint creation leaves a `launching`
context for inspection. A crash after the claim leaves an uncertain active pass,
even if startup never reached delivery. Neither case authorizes automatic launch,
replacement, or prompt replay. Once claimed, output is accepted only during that
controller pass through the normal result parser and final identity checks.

Ctrl+C, SIGTERM, and process cancellation are distinct from graceful pause. Caught
interruption records `interrupted`; it never accepts output as a completed pass
merely because the agent becomes idle. SIGKILL or loss before a result checkpoint
can leave `running` with an active pass. Status reports that recorded claim; it
does not prove a controller is still alive. `--continue` refuses both states.
The exact context/nonce and any previously collected results remain for inspection;
delivery may have succeeded and the agent may still be working. Do not retry or
manufacture completion from a transcript or temporary result file.

After inspecting and reconciling a stopped run, `task loop DEV-20 --new` explicitly
replaces its single checkpoint and requests a fresh reviewer outside the old
automatic continuation. All contexts must pass identity/idle checks. An orphaned
`running`/`ready` claim, uncertain context, or missing session is refused and needs
manual reconciliation of its evidence; there is no automatic recovery/replay or
context repair command. `--new` also intentionally starts another loop after a
clean result or abandons a paused boundary. It does not retain report history.

## Task pr

```sh
task pr DEV-20
```

Running this command authorizes commit, push, and PR creation/update without a
confirmation prompt. It prints the verified PR URL and stops. Human inspection,
approval, merge, and Linear completion remain separate. There are no commit-only
or push-only commands. A failed stage leaves its completed predecessors available
for verification and continuation on the next invocation.

### Review acceptance and public metadata

Publishing uses the same exact repository/worktree/branch/scope and open Herdr
workspace/context resolver as review. It requires the active implementation
mapping and the accepted reviewer's unchanged registry identity. The task must
contain the pinned reviewed base. Publication requires the local and live remote
base to match that review; an unpublished task can first take the rebase path
below when the remote base has advanced.

Review stores one current clean acceptance in
`agentic-workflows-publication.json` in the task worktree's private Git directory,
outside tracked files. It contains issue/repository/worktree/branch/base and
Herdr identities, review context/pass, verdict, timestamp, reviewer settings and
available session identity, the reviewed fingerprint, and bounded public
publication prose (or explicit approval of the frozen publication metadata after
rebase). It contains no full issue description, review findings, chat,
credentials, or general run archive. Failed/blocked/findings results never create
acceptance. Beginning another review explicitly revokes the current acceptance and
publishing intent, including if that new pass is interrupted. Outside the
unpublished rebase path, once a publication commit exists, publication must finish
through `task pr` before another review can replace that contract. Completed cycles
retain their own acceptance and intent. Completed rebase provenance survives a new
review only while its exact resulting Git state is unchanged. It authorizes commit
reuse, never publication without fresh clean
acceptance. Review and publish hold the same process lock, released automatically
on process exit.

The same private record keeps append-only publication lineage, independently of
the current review acceptance and intent. It binds the issue, checkout/branch,
configured base and remote repository to every published cycle, retaining each
accepted review, frozen intent/SHA, and completion state. It also pins the base
commit and PR number and retains the latest positively published SHA. A new
review does not erase this evidence; it prevents automatic rebasing even if the
remote branch and PR are later absent. Only publication contracts accumulate;
review findings and conversations are not archived.

The reviewer supplies public-safe summary, description, and validation prose from
the actual reviewed implementation. This is metadata generation within the
existing read-only review handoff; it cannot select Git/GitHub identities or
perform publishing actions. After automatic rebase, the handoff instead asks the
reviewer to validate the already-frozen title/body, as described below.
`task pr` has no second model invocation and never
falls back to copying a possibly stale task title or private review checks.
Initial clean verdicts without publishing metadata require a new review.

Exactly one canonical primary Linear category label resolves the type:
`Feature` → `feat`, `Bug` → `fix`, `Chore` → `chore`, `Docs` → `docs`,
`Refactor` → `refactor`. Other labels, including `Research`, do not select a type.
Missing or conflicting categories refuse publication. Both commit subject and PR
title use `<type>: <concise actual change> (DEV-20)`. The body contains `Summary`,
`Tracking`, and `Validation`, with a stable linked Linear issue reference in
`Tracking`. Only approved public prose is copied into it; private reviewer
findings and task instructions are not used as a fallback. Public-safety judgment
is supplied by the reviewer, not a deterministic secret-content classifier.

New summaries start with a lower-case imperative verb, usually use 3–8 words,
and preserve proper names and acronyms such as Codex, GitHub, SSH and PR. For
example: `feat: add reviewed task PR publishing (DEV-18)`. Supporting mechanics
belong in the description. The review handoff reserves room for the longest
supported type and the issue suffix so the complete subject fits within 72
characters. New metadata with an uppercase first word, excess length, a repeated
type/issue suffix or sentence-ending punctuation is refused; the workflow does
not silently rewrite accepted prose. Previously frozen titles and bodies remain
unchanged, including through rebase review and retries.

### Mapping the reviewed state to a commit

Before any commit, the full current fingerprint must equal the acceptance. This
includes the exact original HEAD, index, flags, file contents/modes and untracked
inventory. Publication includes final materialized tracked files and non-ignored
new files, with deletions, executable modes and symlinks. For partially staged
files, final working-copy content wins; staged-only intermediate versions are not
separate changes to publish. All intended files must be present during review.
Ignored untracked files remain excluded. Submodules and skip-worktree or
assume-unchanged entries are refused in v1.

A temporary index prepares Git's resulting tree. The tree's actual blob bytes,
paths and modes must exactly represent the reviewed materialized files. Content-
transforming clean filters (including LFS and line-ending conversion), ignored
remnants of staged deletions, and modes that Git ignores are refused in v1. The
real index stays untouched during preparation. The workflow atomically saves
and fsyncs an intent containing the accepted pass, repository/remote identity,
expected tree/index, title/body and exact commit message before invoking commit.
The message includes a `Task-Review` pass-ID trailer. A separate materialized
content digest, excluding absent deleted paths, connects pre-commit bytes/modes to
post-commit bytes/modes. The resulting commit must have exactly the reviewed HEAD
as its sole parent, the intended tree, and the intended message. The real index
is then advanced only from its accepted entries to that proven tree. As soon as
the workflow creates or selects a proven publication commit, it durably freezes
that exact SHA in the intent before any further transport. All later checks,
including retries, require local HEAD to equal this SHA; equivalent parent,
tree and message are insufficient.

Before first publication, an already committed reviewed change receives one
publication commit (possibly an empty tree delta) to establish the generated
subject and pass provenance. The exception is a proven rebased publishing commit:
fresh review authorizes reuse of that exact
commit. Its original trailer remains provenance; the new durable acceptance
authorizes publication. Before first publication, a tree identical to the base
is refused.

The workflow rechecks content, exact commit SHA, and index before push,
immediately after push (including failures), before PR writes, and before
reporting the URL. Hooks retain their normal behavior, but a hook that changes
the message/tree/content causes refusal before push. A pre-push hook that amends
HEAD also causes refusal, even if only author or committer metadata changes:
the remote may already contain the original frozen SHA while local HEAD differs.
The command reports both SHAs and stops before creating or reporting a PR; retries
continue to refuse the changed HEAD. Inspect local/remote history and the hook
before deciding how to recover; the workflow never resets or force-pushes it.
The lock serializes workflow commands, not editors or unrelated Git processes.
Keep the checkout stable throughout publication; changes perfectly restored
between observations cannot be detected.

### Follow-up publication

After a task PR is published, keep additional task edits uncommitted in the same
checkout until they pass a fresh independent `task review`. Then run `task pr`
to append one new publishing commit to the existing branch and reuse the same PR.
Already-published commits are never rewritten. Staged, unstaged and new files can
all participate. Each cycle
creates exactly one commit with the previous published commit as its sole parent,
the exact newly reviewed tree, and its own `Task-Review` pass trailer. A review
without new materialized changes cannot create an empty follow-up commit.
Locally committed follow-ups require manual inspection; the workflow does not
rewrite them to manufacture the required parent.

The previous completed cycles remain unchanged. Before transport, the new SHA is
frozen in the current intent; before push, its acceptance and frozen intent are
saved as a pending cycle. Positive remote confirmation advances the latest
published SHA, while final PR/ref verification marks the cycle complete. A failed
push or evidence write retains the previous published SHA and pending contract.
Retry recovers the same commit even if commit acknowledgement or the initial SHA
write was lost, and skips push if the remote already contains that exact SHA.
A lost PR update acknowledgement is reconciled against the same recorded PR.
New reviews refuse unfinished cycles instead of discarding their retry evidence.

Every later publication verifies the recorded commit objects and their ancestry,
as well as the current review/intent. The remote must be at the previous published
SHA or the current frozen SHA. A missing branch, rollback, unrelated or additional
remote commit, missing/replaced PR, or changed PR repository/head/base refuses the
operation. PR number is durable identity: matching branch names alone cannot
authorize a replacement PR. All pushes use the existing normal, explicit SHA
refspec; no amend, rebase, reset, or force-push extends published history.

The initial reviewed base commit remains pinned for this lineage. Local or remote
base movement stops follow-up publication without fetching or changing task
history. Updating the local base and requesting a fresh review cannot bypass this
restriction. Review currently uses a single base both for the diff and for the
required ancestor/live target identity. Supporting an advanced target safely would
require separate immutable diff-base and observed target-tip identities, with an
independent review of integration against that target and fresh target checks
before transport. That integration model is not implemented; inspect and review
advanced-base integration manually while preserving published commits.

Legacy publication evidence still forbids rewriting. A retry retaining the
original accepted review and provable publishing intent can establish a completed
cycle and pin the discovered matching PR. The older observation is preserved
separately, including a published parent observed before the first workflow
commit; it never becomes a fabricated review approval. Missing acceptance/intent
provenance requires manual inspection; a fresh review cannot reconstruct old
approvals or PR identity.

### Base advancement before first publication

If the live base differs from the accepted base, any remote task branch or PR
history prevents automatic rebasing, even if its SHA otherwise matches. Durable
publication evidence also forbids rebasing after the remote ref is deleted;
an uncertain prior push cannot be treated as proof of no publication. For an
unpublished task, `pr` fetches only the configured base into `FETCH_HEAD`, using
the verified task-worktree remote and native terminal authentication. Both the
reviewed base and permanent checkout must be ancestors of the fetched base.
The clean permanent checkout advances with a guarded fast-forward; divergent or
local-only base history refuses the operation.

Integration runs in a disposable repository sharing only Git objects, with its
own refs, index and files. It replays linear implementation commits followed by
the intended publication commit onto the new base. Probe hooks, signing and
rerere are disabled; the probe never touches the real task branch/index/files.
Checkout preparation also uses a private index: it loads the reviewed source
tree, refreshes file metadata, and dry-runs the two-tree checkout against the
actual files. Refreshing is necessary when upstream changes an existing tracked
file; loading a tree alone does not establish that file's current stat data.
Setup errors, checkout preflight failures, or rebase conflicts stop with the
exact reviewed task index, files and HEAD unchanged. The permanent
base may already have advanced. Task histories containing merge commits require
manual rebasing in v1. Ignored files that would obstruct upstream paths also
cause refusal; move them aside before retrying.

After a clean probe, the workflow saves a bounded rebase journal and revokes the
old acceptance before installing anything. The journal records source state,
target base, expected commit trees/messages/authors, created commit IDs, the
completed fingerprint, and the frozen publication title/body with their metadata
fingerprint. This is one current continuation record, not a run
archive. Real replacement commits preserve implementation authors and honor the
task worktree's normal signing settings. No hooks can modify this precomputed
chain. Before installation, remote refs/PR history and permanent/task identities
are checked again. Checkout preparation is repeated in a private index, then the
real Git index is locked and task state rechecked. Checkout updates files and the
private index; only a successful checkout allows atomic replacement of the real
index. The reviewed source tree is never staged into the real index as a setup
step. A compare-and-swap branch update completes installation without running a
rebase sequencer in the real task worktree.

The command then stops with an explicit requirement for a new independent
`task review`. It cannot push or create a PR in that invocation. A pending
installation must finish through `task pr` before review; retries verify saved
commit IDs and the allowed source/target checkout states. If files reached the
planned target but index replacement was interrupted, the original index and
HEAD must still match the source; retry installs the proven target index and
reuses the same commits. Partial file updates or other drift that do not match a
proven state require manual inspection.

The fresh review explicitly receives that exact title/body and their fingerprint.
It must validate their accuracy against the rebased result, including the linked
issue, validation claims and public safety. A clean verdict must include a
`publication_approval` matching that metadata fingerprint. Missing or mismatched
approval cannot create clean acceptance; inaccurate or unsafe metadata calls for
findings or a blocked review. Metadata drift observed during the pass invalidates
it just as Git-visible drift does.

The durable acceptance binds this approval to the new pass and reviewed Git
fingerprint. `pr` checks it alongside the rebased commit provenance and reuses the
frozen title/body on every continuation, including after commit/push/PR failures.
It never regenerates them from the fresh reviewer's summary. The reviewer's own
conclusion or optional replacement publication prose may use different wording;
neither changes the frozen metadata. Older rebase records that did not retain the
title/body cannot be reconstructed safely and require manual inspection.

### Remote, PR and retry checks

The configured base must track a same-named branch on one GitHub remote. Fetch
and push destinations must each resolve to a single URL for the same repository;
conflicting repositories or multiple destinations are refused. The effective
remote is resolved with the task worktree's Git configuration, including worktree
settings and conditional includes, and must match the permanent checkout's
approved remote/repository identity. It is rechecked before each ref lookup,
fetch and push. Transport uses that remote's name so Git expands URL rewrites
once; an already-expanded URL is never passed back through Git's rewrite rules. Mirror
remotes and remote groups are refused. Push uses an explicit commit SHA and task
branch refspec, without force, tags or submodule pushes. Live `ls-remote` refs are
authoritative; cached tracking refs and task branch push defaults are not used.

Before the first push attempt, a pending marker is saved and fsynced. Observing
the remote task ref records positive publication evidence; a verified successful
push must save that evidence before any GitHub write or success reporting. The
positive record for each cycle is retained for that branch's workflow state, including
across fresh/failed reviews. Later pending pushes do not downgrade it. If the
push acknowledgement or confirmation write fails, the pending marker survives:
retry can verify or push the same commit, but cannot automatically rebase after
the remote ref disappears. Failed evidence writes stop publication. Legacy
records with an existing intent but no push history are treated as uncertain,
rather than assumed never published.

Before first publication, the task branch may be absent, at the accepted
pre-publication HEAD, or already at the proven publication commit. Once positively
published, the branch must exist; follow-ups allow only the prior published SHA or
the current frozen SHA. Anything else conflicts.
After push it must equal the publication commit. All PR history for this exact
repository/head participates: there must be no PR, or exactly one open, unmerged
PR with the configured base and expected head SHA. A fork, another base, closed
or merged history, multiple PRs, or changing responses refuse publication. The
matching PR is reused and its title/body updated if necessary. The confirmed PR
and remote SHA are checked before reporting its URL. Immediately before every
PR POST/PATCH, after the preceding GitHub lookups, the workflow rechecks the
effective destination and authoritative remote task SHA against the frozen
publishing state. Task-ref or identity drift refuses the write. Local HEAD and
reviewed contents are checked again after that native ref lookup. These checks cannot lock GitHub
against unrelated changes between the final observation and the API write.
The remote base must match the reviewed base before a new push. Once the exact
published task SHA is confirmed, later main advancement does not make publication
uncertain or prevent completing/retrying that frozen PR operation. The PR may
subsequently need integration; v1 does not rewrite published history. Uncertainty
concerns unconfirmed push/ref/PR outcomes, not base freshness. The server's ref
update during a non-force push is the concurrency boundary for the task branch;
it does not atomically compare main or encompass PR API operations.
GitHub owner/repository
casing is equivalent, including in the reported PR URL. URL scheme, host, path,
PR number, head/base branch names and head SHA remain strictly validated.

After a follow-up push, including recovery of an unfinished publication, PR
verification permits at most five observations within a five-second retry window
when either GitHub response still names the previously published parent SHA.
The recorded PR number, repository, head branch, base and open/unmerged state must
match throughout. Before retrying, native refs and local state must prove the exact
frozen publishing SHA. Both PR responses must converge to that SHA before use;
an unexpected third SHA, changed identity or API error fails immediately. These
retries repeat reads only, never PR writes, commits or pushes. Normal API request
timeouts still apply; convergence observed after the retry window is refused.

To reduce repeated authentication, a preflight observation that the remote task
ref already equals the frozen publishing SHA skips the push stage. After a new
push, remote confirmation shares the next required check after PR lookup. If
that lookup fails, the workflow still checks the refs and saves positive push
evidence before stopping; a confirmation failure is reported alongside the API
failure. A fresh publish normally needs four `ls-remote` calls and one push. A
retry with the branch already published needs three ref lookups if it creates or
updates a PR, or two if the PR already matches. Checks immediately before writes
and after the final GitHub lookup remain fresh, and local state is checked after
native transport. These reductions do not cache credentials or change Git/SSH
configuration; native prompts remain in the invoking terminal.

| Interruption | Next `task pr` invocation |
| --- | --- |
| Before commit | Recheck acceptance and saved intent, then commit once. |
| Commit completed, including a lost command acknowledgement | Require the frozen SHA if present; otherwise prove parent/tree/message/content and freeze the recovered SHA. Finish the index update if needed and reuse that commit. |
| Push failed or its acknowledgement was lost | Inspect live refs; push only if the exact commit is absent. |
| Published ref was deleted, or an uncertain push can no longer be observed | Retain publication evidence and forbid automatic rebase; inspect history manually. |
| PR creation failed or its acknowledgement was lost | Enumerate all matching history first; reuse the unique matching PR or create if absent. |
| Metadata update/reporting failed | Revalidate and reconcile the same PR, then report its URL. |
| Unpublished base advanced | Probe integration, install only a conflict-free rebase, invalidate review and stop for a fresh independent pass. |
| Rebase installation interrupted | Verify and reuse the saved replacement commits, finish only a provable checkout/ref transition, then require review. |
| Fresh review after rebase | Require explicit approval of the frozen title/body for the reviewed state; reuse the exact rebased commit and metadata through push/PR. |
| New edits after completed publication | Obtain a new clean review at the latest published HEAD; append one commit and reuse the recorded PR. |
| New review during unfinished publication | Refuse before replacing acceptance/intent; finish the frozen cycle with `task pr`. |
| Files/index/history/identity conflicts, or base change after publication | Stop without force or repair; inspect the reported state. A new review cannot bypass published ancestry, PR identity or the pinned base. |

Do not delete or edit acceptance/intent records to bypass refusal. Rerunning `pr`
continues a frozen contract, while explicitly running `review` after completed
publication starts a new one.
Neither a fresh review nor deletion of a remote ref clears publication history.

### Authentication and signing

The REST API uses `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`; see
[GitHub publishing configuration](configuration.md#github-publishing).
API failures name the selected credential variable (never its value), HTTP
status when available, and a safe category such as authentication, token
permissions, SSO, rate limiting, request validation, DNS/TLS, timeout, or invalid
JSON. Diagnostics use fixed guidance and allowlisted validation field/code names;
raw response bodies, arbitrary headers, exception text, and request payloads are
not echoed. Publishing refuses missing/malformed credentials before transport.
A failed write is never automatically replayed: a connection failure, service
error, or unreadable response may follow a successful write. Rerun `task pr`
after addressing the cause; it discovers and verifies any matching PR before
deciding whether another create/update request is necessary.

Commit/push/fetch inherit stdin, stdout and stderr. Ref lookup and rebased commit
creation read only protocol stdout (refs or an object ID) and inherit stdin/stderr.
Git's SSH/GPG/credential tools retain the caller's console and controlling
terminal; the workflow never reads passphrase
input, captures prompts, or writes secrets into artifacts.
Native failures and a five-minute operation timeout produce an actionable error
without echoing captured command output. Normal Git signing and authentication
configuration stays in effect. Non-interactive callers must provide already
usable credentials/signing access or handle a native failure; the workflow never
supplies credentials to a prompt or weakens authentication.

## Task integrate

```sh
task integrate DEV-20
task integrate DEV-20 --agent codex --model gpt-6-astra --mode high
task integrate DEV-20 --timeout 1800
```

Use this explicit recovery command when an unpublished, clean-reviewed task has
uncommitted implementation changes and the base has advanced into a conflict.
`task pr` remains the deterministic first attempt and never invokes an integration
agent. `integrate` independently repeats all prerequisites and the disposable
replay; no earlier failed `pr` or conflict journal is required. A conflict-free
probe directs the caller back to `pr`. Setup errors do not count as conflicts.

The single execution role resolves from `[agent]`; `--agent`, `--model`, and
`--mode` override those fields independently. Explicit resolved model and mode
are required before mutation or launch. `[reviewer]` and the implementation
context's saved settings do not select this agent. The default completion timeout
is 1800 seconds, starting after confirmed handoff delivery.

V1 requires reviewed task HEAD to equal the reviewed base: staged, unstaged,
deleted, and non-ignored untracked changes are materialized from the exact clean
acceptance using a private index. Committed task histories, pending/uncertain
publication evidence, any remote task branch or PR history, a previous integration
record, and ambiguous source identity require inspection/manual recovery. Index
flags, submodules, filter/mode transformations, ignored obstructions, and unsafe
checkout preflights retain the publisher's existing refusals. Neither this command
nor its agent uses stash or rebases the real dirty worktree.
The existing workspace's recorded slice is included in the handoff and retained
in integration provenance, as in task start/review. When a slice is recorded,
only that slice is integrated; other issue requirements remain context. Ambiguous
slice scope requires `human_decision`. Scope drift refuses installation, including
continuation of a proven installation through `task pr`.

The configured remote and authoritative base/task refs are checked, all PR
history participates, and the clean permanent checkout may fast-forward to the
verified latest base, as in `pr`. The real task branch, index, and files remain
unchanged during the disposable probe and agent pass. After an actual deterministic
conflict, the workflow reproduces it in a durable machine-local repository under
`~/.agentic-workflows/integrations/<pass-id>/checkout`. It has its own object
storage, no configured remote, and workflow-pinned source/base refs. The workflow
quits the isolated rebase sequencer while retaining the conflicted index/files;
the agent resolves with ordinary file edits, creation, and deletion. It does not
stage or remove files through Git, write Git metadata, or create commits. Unmerged
index entries remain during the agent pass; staging belongs to the controller.

A fresh `DEV-20-G1` context binds that checkout and a separate pane, preserving
the original implementation context. The handoff includes current Linear
requirements, exact accepted source fingerprint and identity, updated base,
and conflicted index entries. Prompt delivery and provider verification use the
existing adapters and immutable session guards. A bounded private record in the
real task's Git metadata claims delivery before the prompt is sent. It also records
the completion file's location, outside every checkout in a private
`task-integration-<pass-id>-*` directory under Python's temporary root (normally
`/tmp`, or `TMPDIR`). This uses the documented Codex profile's existing temporary
write access without adding writable roots or granting Git metadata writes.
Neither the checkout nor the completion directory is automatically removed on
return or interruption. The record is not a review acceptance or authorization
to publish. A temporary root inside a source or isolated checkout is refused.

The agent may edit and validate only the isolated checkout and write its result
outside it. It must not commit, change history/configuration, push, create/update
PRs, merge, or modify Linear. Product, architecture, scope, design, or semantic
ambiguity must produce `human_decision` with evidence. Completion is structured:
`completed`, `human_decision`, `blocked`, or `failed`, bound to the pass, source
fingerprint, and base SHA, with a summary and observed validation checks. Successful
completion requires at least one passed validation check and no failed checks.

Only a verified idle/completed session with valid successful output can proceed.
The workflow first proves unchanged isolated history/configuration and index,
then stages the edited files and deletions itself. The staged result must pass
`git diff --cached --check`, including conflict-marker and whitespace checks.
It then proves no unmerged paths or unfinished operation, stable file content,
and a lossless resulting tree. Failed, blocked, or uncertain agent completions
never authorize staging.
It imports only the proven tree/blob objects and repeats checkout preflight,
source/acceptance/identity checks, and latest base/remote/PR checks. Removing
textual conflict markers alone is insufficient. These checks and the subsequent
independent review complement the integration agent's reported validation.

Before touching the task, the complete integration proof and installation plan
are durably saved. The existing publication record then revokes old clean
acceptance and intent and saves the rebase journal. The normal installer creates
workflow-owned local commit history, honoring normal signing, and uses a private
index, exclusive real-index lock, repeated local proof/source checks, and compare-and-swap
branch update. The command stops after local installation; it never publishes or
marks the Linear issue complete. A fresh independent `task review` of the installed
state against the frozen base SHA B, including the frozen public title/body, is
mandatory before `task pr` can publish. Review preserves B even if main has
advanced. Resuming a reviewer is still an independent pass against that exact state.

Initial installation and `task pr` recovery use one required installation guard.
It pins the proven integration record separately from evolving commit/result
bookkeeping and rechecks the live task identity, recorded scope, proven source,
frozen base SHA, tree/history, and durable provenance immediately before file checkout,
index replacement, branch/HEAD movement, and atomic replacement of either success
record. Unreachable commit objects and private indexes confer no installation
authority. Drift stops further mutations and preserves pending evidence, including any earlier guarded steps;
the workflow neither rolls those steps back nor records a stale installation as
successful. The guard validates local state, including the configured repository/
remote identity, without polling remote refs or requiring an idle permanent
checkout. The base object B remains immutable in the proof; a moving main ref
is not part of the installation identity.

`task integrate` owns local installation safety; `task pr` owns remote publication
eligibility. Remote observations establish eligibility before the proof is frozen.
After that, local installation and its recovery may complete against B even if
remote/permanent main advances or a remote task branch appears. Installation never
authorizes publication or overwrites a remote ref. `task pr` can recover a pending
local plan without remote Git/PR lookups or GitHub credentials and then stops for
review.
After review, it checks current remote refs/history: newer main requires the
existing deterministic unpublished integration and another review, or explicit
conflict recovery within the supported v1 shape. An unexpected remote task ref
is retained as publication evidence and refused under the normal publishing rules.
Repeated remote reads cannot synchronize GitHub state with local file mutations.

`integrate`, `review`, and `pr` hold the same task-level lock. After controller
interruption releases that lock, the retained integration claim also gates later
review/publication. Human escalation, failed/malformed output, timeout, uncertain
delivery, or failed source/base/publication eligibility before proof installs
nothing. During installation, local drift stops further mutation and retains any
journaled intermediate state; external ref movement does not invalidate the proof.
The checkout and context are retained, and rerunning `integrate` refuses
to replay a prompt. Missing controller state alongside known integration contexts
also refuses; it is never treated as permission for a fresh launch.

For an unrecoverable uncertain Codex attempt with no recorded provider session,
an explicit human recovery action can abandon that exact context:

```sh
task contexts DEV-30 --all
task integrate DEV-30 --abandon DEV-30-G1
task integrate DEV-30
```

`--abandon` launches nothing and does not install or infer a result. It only
supports an `uncertain` G context with `unknown` resumability, no recorded session identity,
no completion/output or installation proof, unchanged isolated Git history, and
remaining unmerged paths. The exact task/checkout/context identities must match.
Agent/model/mode/timeout overrides cannot accompany abandonment.

Absence of a recorded session or an idle status alone is insufficient. The
original Herdr pane must be absent or contain its exact idle shell; a moved or
replaced terminal refuses. Readable local Linux process evidence must confirm no
execution using that checkout, including background children of the retained
shell. Run this recovery on the same host/PID namespace as Herdr; invisible host
processes cannot prove absence. Ordinarily Codex must report no current or archived
sessions for the checkout across providers and supported source types.
Provider/process failures, incomplete results, known sessions, live execution,
or identity drift refuse abandonment.
Other agents/platforms and more complex recovery cases remain manual inspection.

An old pre-sandbox-fix attempt may instead have an unrecorded Codex conversation
that completed only the native handoff-readiness exchange. Herdr can report that
Codex process as `idle` while it is still running in the foreground. Abandonment
refuses and identifies the exact pane, terminal, and process IDs. Inspect and quit
Codex yourself in that pane, keeping the original shell/pane and evidence, then
repeat the same `--abandon` command. The workflow sends no terminal input and never
terminates or resumes that conversation for you.

Only legacy claims lacking the newer output/scope/index fields support this
exception, and the original shell must remain observable. After proving the
process has stopped, the controller requires exactly one unarchived CLI session
for the isolated checkout, no archived sessions, no fork or parent, exactly one completed full
turn containing the canonical readiness prompt and final `READY`, and an empty
durable input queue. It repeats the history/queue observations and process check.
Any task input, extra turn/item, tool activity, incomplete/paginated history,
pending delivery, or identity change refuses. A visible `READY` alone proves
nothing. The discovered provider identity, complete readiness turn, and empty
queue evidence are archived with G1; its startup history is retained but never
used to resume integration. G2 still requires a separate explicit command.

Under the task lock, the controller durably records the explicit abandonment and
an archive in private Git metadata before retiring G1 with its identity fields
intact. `task contexts --all` retains it as `abandoned`. Its checkout, conflict
index/files, output directory, original attempt evidence, and abandonment proof
are kept; nothing is deleted and review/publication authorization is unchanged.
If interrupted before archival/retirement finishes, normal commands still refuse;
repeat the exact `--abandon` action explicitly to recheck absence and finish.
Missing or conflicting provenance never authorizes a retry.

Only a separate normal `task integrate` after completed abandonment may allocate
G2. It repeats current acceptance, source/base, remote/publication, and deterministic
conflict checks, using a fresh checkout/context and leaving G1's evidence intact.
Successful installation still revokes the old review and requires a fresh
independent review. The abandoned checkout is never a source of an installable
result.

Once both the integration proof and revoked-acceptance rebase journal are durable,
a pending installation can continue through `task pr` using its existing proven
source/target recovery states and saved commit IDs. That invocation finishes
installation and demands review; it cannot publish. A crash between proof storage
and authorization revocation, or ambiguous partial file updates, requires manual
inspection. The original index survives a failed checkout/index replacement;
recovery never infers an arbitrary partial installation. New source, base, remote,
or identity drift refuses continuation. Older integration proofs without recorded
slice scope require inspection before installation can continue.

There is no automatic cleanup or resume of integration checkouts or completion
directories in v1, including after success. Explicit
[forced local-execution disposal](#forced-local-execution-disposal) can remove a never-published
execution and its retained artifacts. Otherwise inspect `task contexts DEV-20 --all`,
the retained pane/checkout, completion output, and private provenance before manual
reconciliation. Lost output is never permission to replay a prompt. Preserve
valuable resolutions
and establish that the agent has stopped before any manual cleanup. Do not delete
controller or approval records to bypass a refusal. Complex or published histories
remain manual recovery; force-push and merge-commit rewriting are not supported.

## Task cleanup

After a task is completed and its branch is merged into the configured local base:

```sh
task cleanup DEV-7
```

Cleanup uses the same Linear project/repository mapping and Git/Herdr workspace
resolver as `task start`. It requires Linear's `completed` state type, regardless
of the status display name. The issue identifier, registered branch, checkout,
and recorded task scope must agree; the current title and filesystem naming are
not used to locate the worktree. Exactly one local task branch and one matching
registered Herdr worktree are required. Multiple slices are refused.

### Merge evidence

The permanent checkout must be clean and on the configured base. Cleanup checks
the local base without fetching or updating it; update it separately if needed.
If the task tip is reachable from that base, Git ancestry proves the merge.
Otherwise cleanup uses the existing GitHub PR-history lookup for the base's
upstream repository. It requires exactly one PR for the task branch, confirmed
merged into the configured base, with a head SHA identical to the local task tip.
The PR's resulting merge/squash commit must also be reachable from the local base.
The complete PR listing and individual PR response must agree. Extra local commits,
missing/ambiguous evidence, another head/base/repository, unavailable API access,
or a merge commit absent from the local base all cause refusal. Linear completion,
matching titles/messages, and patch similarity alone never prove a merge.

Squash verification supports `github.com` and uses the same optional `GH_TOKEN` or
`GITHUB_TOKEN` as the existing history checks. It reads PR evidence without changing
GitHub state. Non-ancestor cleanup on other hosts is refused.

### Removal checks and Python caches

All removal preconditions are checked before deletion and checked again just
before removal. Cleanup normally refuses dirty task worktrees (including
untracked and ignored files), index flags that hide modifications, unfinished Git
operations, submodules, locked/prunable/detached or mismatched worktrees,
missing/invalid task scope metadata, and any target that could remove the
permanent checkout, Git metadata, or another registered worktree.

The sole dirty-state exception is ignored Python bytecode directly inside
`__pycache__` directories. Cleanup first inspects the complete tracked,
untracked, and ignored state. It removes those directories only when every dirty
entry is a regular `.pyc` or `.pyo` file in such a directory and every directory
entry was present in that Git snapshot. A source change, symlink, loose bytecode,
nested/unknown cache content, or any other ignored or untracked file preserves
everything and refuses cleanup. The complete target validation runs again after
cache removal.

### Git removal, Herdr retirement, and retries

On success, non-force Git commands remove the exact registered worktree and then
its local branch; the output names both. Ancestry-proven branches use `branch -d`.
For a verified squash/rebase PR, cleanup rechecks that no worktree uses the branch
and deletes its exact local ref with `update-ref --no-deref -d`, supplying the
verified old SHA so a changed branch cannot be deleted. It does not use `-D` or
rewrite the task branch to manufacture ancestry. Remote branches, PRs, and Linear
status are not changed.

After Git cleanup, the command closes the exact open Herdr workspace identified
by the stable ID returned for the validated worktree. It confirms the ID's
repository and checkout path before closing it and confirms the ID disappeared
afterward; labels are never used as retirement identity. The exact association is
saved in Git-private metadata before removal, so a retry can finish closing a
stale workspace after the worktree and branch are already gone. Conflicting,
missing, or ambiguous identity refuses retirement. A close failure reports Git's
completed portion without claiming Herdr success and retains the retry state.
Each retry first uses a no-follow filesystem check to prove the saved checkout
path has no object, confirms no Git worktree has reused it, and revalidates the
workspace's repository key and task identity. Reuse or inconsistency preserves
both the workspace and retry record.
For a legacy cleanup that predates this retry metadata, the command checks Herdr
before reporting that nothing remains. It accepts exactly one absent linked
checkout only when Herdr's stable workspace ID, exact repository root/key, exact
issue label, and issue-prefixed checkout basename all agree. A label or path match
alone is insufficient; partial or multiple matches are left untouched.

If worktree removal fails, branch deletion and Herdr retirement are not attempted.
If branch deletion fails afterward, cleanup reports the partial result; a
branch-only retry refuses and leaves that branch for manual inspection. Run
cleanup from outside the task workspace after exiting its agent/shell sessions,
and do not modify the repository, task worktree, or Herdr workspace concurrently
with cleanup.

### Forced local-execution disposal

```sh
task cleanup DEV-30 --force
```

`--force` is destructive authorization to discard one selected,
**never-published local execution**, including modified, staged, untracked and
ignored task files. This authorization is independent of the Linear issue state:
the issue may remain In Progress, and cleanup does not update its status. Without
`--force`, the completed-task contract above is unchanged.

Quit the execution's agents before running this command from outside all
task/integration checkouts. Empty shells in the exact task workspace may
remain: cleanup proves their identity and closes that workspace. An `idle` agent
status alone is insufficient. Cleanup compares Herdr's shell argv with the local
Linux process executable and argv, and requires a sleeping shell with its own
foreground terminal and session. Only ordinary interactive/login invocations of
system shells under `/bin` or `/usr/bin` are supported; script/command arguments,
missing evidence, and an exec-replaced shell PID refuse disposal.

Ownership has three meanings, derived from the existing context registry,
integration provenance and per-execution disposal journals:

- **claimed**: an execution still owns a resource, even when its runtime stopped.
- **disposing**: a pending journal reserves its exact frozen resources through
  interruption and retry.
- **released**: confirmed cleanup/retirement released the relevant resource;
  retained records describe history and do not claim a later execution.

Runtime retirement is separate from artifact release. In particular, an
`abandoned` G context retains its integration checkout and provenance despite
having a retirement timestamp. A retired G runtime also retains its artifact
claim until an exact completed disposal covers it. Cleanup reads retained context
history, current and archived integration records (including preparing passes
without a G context), registered worktrees/private Git directories, and disposal
journals in registry-known repositories. Overlapping unreleased claims from
another execution refuse cleanup, including another issue's abandoned G context.
Normal implementation/review retirement ends the runtime claim; existing Git
registration and retained provenance independently continue to protect artifacts.

A completed journal releases only its frozen context/resource identities, not
all future occupants of an issue ID or path. Context ordinals, immutable disposal
journals and bounded integration tombstones remain historical evidence. They do
not block a later execution with new contexts and its own disposal journal.

Process safety is scoped to the **registered execution**. Cleanup checks the
exact Herdr terminals and positive shell identity, UID-independent ancestry,
related threads, and remaining jobs in recorded shell sessions/process groups.
It reads ancestry metadata to discover those jobs, but does not inspect unrelated
processes' private cwd, executable, root, descriptors, mappings or mount namespace.
Known descendants block even when their UID or working directory changed. Missing
required ancestry, thread or shell evidence fails closed. Kernel classification
uses Linux's `PF_KTHREAD` flag, never a name; it cannot exempt a claimed shell or
execution descendant. Unrelated process churn does not invalidate the proof.
These checks run again immediately before each destructive operation, and closed
registered shells must actually exit. Historical provider conversations remain
outside disposal. Older pending journals without recorded shell-session proof
still require inspection; they are not silently promoted to new evidence.

V1 does not prove a global absence of host references. Unmanaged editors,
detached daemons, escaped/reparented jobs outside recorded execution families,
containers and arbitrary external bind aliases are outside this guarantee.
Stop unmanaged activity yourself before using force. Stronger guarantees need
runner-owned process groups/cgroups, durable membership or leases, and controlled
filesystem access; repeated host-wide snapshots cannot provide those guarantees.

It refuses live agents, unrelated panes, moved or replaced terminals, another
Herdr endpoint, inaccessible process evidence, and other registry contexts
claiming the workspace or disposable paths. Run on the same host/PID namespace
as Herdr. The command does not send terminal input, quit
agents, or resume provider sessions. Historical provider conversations remain
outside this disposal operation.

The permanent checkout must be clean and on the configured base. Exact Git
registration, task scope, branch, checkout and stable Herdr workspace identity
must agree. Multiple branches/worktrees/slices, unsafe or aliased paths, nested
repositories (including bare repositories), mounts, and identity drift refuse
disposal. Cleanup reads Linux
`/proc/self/mountinfo` before traversal and rechecks all deletion trees before
removal, including linked Git metadata and retained integration/output trees.
Mount boundaries at or below any deletion root refuse disposal, including
same-filesystem directory and file bind mounts. Mount metadata also resolves overlap between registered workflow resource
claims exposed through different mount views; it is not used to enumerate host
process references through arbitrary external aliases. Cleanup rechecks direct
mount boundaries before deletion. Unreadable or malformed mount information
refuses cleanup. Dirty task files
are allowed only on this explicit path. Live remote task refs, retained task tracking
refs/configuration, any GitHub PR history (including open or closed PRs), or private
publication history/intent also refuse. Cached refs are resolved against complete
remote names (including slashes) and effective fetch configuration in both
checkouts. Only name-preserving `refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/<remote>/*` fetch
mappings, optionally prefixed with `+`, are accepted automatically. Custom,
negative, empty, or malformed fetch mappings require manual inspection; orphaned
or overlapping cached namespaces also refuse disposal. Effective branch `remote`, `merge`, and
`pushRemote` settings are checked in both the permanent and exact task checkout,
including worktree-local configuration and conditional includes. Any effective
`remote.*.push` setting also refuses disposal, including empty or multivalued
settings: custom push refspecs can publish under another name, and current refs
cannot establish historical mapping identity. Remote/PR checks
require access and a GitHub repository with unambiguous remote identity; they never
fetch, publish, delete remote branches, or change Linear. Missing or conflicting integration
provenance refuses deletion of its retained artifacts.

The command supports a dirty reviewed worktree with implementation/review
contexts, an uncertain integration context and its isolated checkout, including
legacy claims without an external completion directory. It also includes earlier
explicitly abandoned integration attempts when their archives still agree.
Stale context workspace IDs are accepted only when those workspaces and terminals
are absent and their issue/repository/checkout/endpoint identities agree. Retained
integration checkouts must live in their exact workflow-owned pass directories;
external completion directories must match the recorded pass and contain only
the completion output. Unrelated execution state is left intact.

Before deletion, a bounded, atomically replaced and fsynced journal in the common
Git directory (`agentic-workflows-cleanup/DEV-30.discard/<execution-id>.json`)
records the exact selectors and provenance. Each disposal claim has a unique
execution ID and journal. Completed journals, including legacy `state.json`
tombstones, remain unchanged when a later execution of the same issue is cleaned
up, even if it reuses the branch or checkout path. Integration tombstones retain
pass/context identity, source/base identity, disposition and hashes of original
provenance, installation/completion/abandonment evidence, and any retained completion file.
They do not preserve the full conflicted files, result reports, or checkout.
The journal is limited to 4 MiB and at most 101 integration record inputs;
exceeding those bounds refuses automatic disposal. Review/loop/private task
metadata disappears with the task's linked Git directory.

Cleanup takes an exclusive machine-local ownership lock beside the context
registry. Workflow controllers, preparation, context mutations and integration
provenance writes take its shared side. Other controllers may run concurrently,
but cleanup refuses while a controller holds the gate; claim mutations refuse
while cleanup owns it. Locks release on controller exit. Pending journals continue
to reserve resources afterward: allocation, rebinding and provenance writes cannot
acquire overlapping reservations. Context inspection remains read-only.

Cleanup also holds one disposal lock shared by all journals for the issue and the
existing task publication lock while the task exists. It revalidates ownership,
paths/mounts and registered runtime immediately before destructive operations,
and saves a durable claim before each step:

1. Close and confirm absence of the exact Herdr workspace and its stopped shells.
2. Remove the archived integrations' isolated checkout directories and recorded
   disposable completion directories.
3. Revalidate and forcibly remove the exact task worktree, then delete only the
   recorded local branch ref with an atomic comparison to its saved SHA.
4. Retire the frozen context rows transactionally. Ordinals, allocation identity,
   former location and retirement time remain; terminal/provider/session bindings
   are cleared. Registry rows are never deleted or reset.

After interruption, rerun the same `--force` command; the Linear issue state
remains unchanged. A pending journal blocks other workspace lifecycle resolution
rather than reopening or recreating execution. A claimed operation whose result is
confirmed absent can finish on retry, including a branch-only remainder after
worktree removal. Partial artifact deletion may continue only in the original
directory. Reused paths, changed refs, new contexts, conflicting evidence, or
uncertain worktree registration stop for inspection. Do not prune registrations,
delete journals, or reset contexts to bypass a refusal. A successful retry leaves
no active task worktree, local task branch, workspace, context, or retained
integration checkout; its bounded tombstone remains for audit. Published-task
abandonment and general historical garbage collection remain out of scope.
